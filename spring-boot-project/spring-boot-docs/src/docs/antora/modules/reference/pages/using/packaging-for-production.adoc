= Packaging Your Application for Production

Once your Spring Boot application is ready for production deployment, there are many options for packaging and optimizing
the application.
See the xref:packaging/index.adoc[] section of the documentation to read about these features.

For additional "production ready" features, such as health, auditing, and metric REST or JMX end-points, consider adding `spring-boot-actuator`.
See xref:how-to:actuator.adoc[] for details.
