= Messaging

The Spring Framework provides extensive support for integrating with messaging systems, from simplified use of the JMS API using javadoc:org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate[] to a complete infrastructure to receive messages asynchronously.
Spring AMQP provides a similar feature set for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol.
Spring Boot also provides auto-configuration options for javadoc:org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.RabbitTemplate[] and RabbitMQ.
Spring WebSocket natively includes support for STOMP messaging, and Spring Boot has support for that through starters and a small amount of auto-configuration.
Spring Boot also has support for Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar.
